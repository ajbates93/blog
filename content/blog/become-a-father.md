Hello, everyone!

A bit of a different topic for this blog post - a major life event unfolded for me back in August, my partner Vicky and I welcomed our little boy, Noah, into the world! I'm going to keep this one short because there's not a lot to say other than that becoming a parent & experiencing paternity leave (which I was fortunate enough to get a full month off - a lot compared to most in the UK) has been the most incredible experience of my life.

I've found it to be a fairly serious mindset shift as my evenings have shifted from casually coding on the sofa, maybe with a glass of wine or a beer and the TV on in the background, to basically the same thing... it's just now I have a little one asleep on top of me, so using the laptop is a little tricker. I've found that I'm spending less time exploring new technologies through code and more through reading blog posts/articles that come up through various subreddits/feeds. **Learning to be more efficient with your time seems more important than ever, now.** Also learning the importance of having everything that you will need for the next few hours around you within reaching distance is incredibly important, so as not to wake the beast when he's finally gone down for a nap. One executive decision I took was to (impulse) buy a Nintendo Switch 2, which has been a game-changer when it comes to being nap-trapped!

I'm sure as time goes on I'll find some more time for working on projects in the evening, but until then I'm more than happy being used as a portable mattress for Noah on an evening.
