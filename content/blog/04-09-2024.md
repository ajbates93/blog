These are just a few thoughts I've had over the past couple of months as I've
been building out a new project in my spare time.

I started playing Padel at the start of this year and it is A.D.D.I.C.T.I.V.E!
Once a week doesn't feel like enough but when it takes up 3 hours of your
evening... it kind of has to be.

That being said, I've had a real painpoint with organising the games. This is
basically how it goes:

1. I sent a message in the group chat to see who's available over the course of
   a week. This is done on WhatsApp and typically done through a poll.
2. Once we have a date and time, I then have to book the court. This is done
   through the Playtomic app (which, to be fair, is pretty good).
3. I then have to go back to the group chat and confirm the booking(s). This is
   done through WhatsApp again. I also 'sticky' a message' in the chat so that
   we can keep track of who's playing when.
4. On the day, I have to make sure everyone knows where the court is and what
   time we're playing. This is done through WhatsApp again.
5. Towards the end of the month, I have to make sure everyone pays their share. This is done
   through WhatsApp again, and kept track of through a Google Sheet.
